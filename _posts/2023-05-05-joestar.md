imf, is a machine from Vulnhub platform. I recommend you do these CTF because for the certification called eCCptv2 the last machine will be something like this 


**We will see all this from the perspective and methodology of a penetration test.**

- Links to the machines: [Joestar](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/bizarre-adventure-joestar,590/)
- Difficulty assigned by Vulnhub: Medium
- The IP of the machine in my case will be: 192.168.100.52 (You will have a different ip so change it for all steps)

Let's get them!



## Enumeration

we have to figure out the ip of the machine so we need to use arp scan tool 
To do this we will make use of arp-scan and use a series of parameters that will make your search faster.

```bash
arp-scan -Iens33 --localnet
```

The explanation of the meaning of each parameter is:

- ```-I-``` : We have to indicate our interface in my case will be ens33 in your case could be eth0.
- ```--localnet``` : We indicate that the search will be for our localnet.

output
```php
❯ arp-scan -Iens33 --localnet
Interface: ens33, type: EN10MB, MAC: 00:0c:29:f2:37:49, IPv4: 192.168.100.53
Starting arp-scan 1.9.7 with 256 hosts (https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan)
192.168.100.1	64:5e:10:84:35:47	(Unknown)
192.168.100.10	90:e8:68:d0:da:47	(Unknown)
192.168.100.5	58:9a:3e:6e:27:40	(Unknown)
192.168.100.7	24:18:c6:dc:bd:cd	(Unknown)
192.168.100.52	00:0c:29:d2:5a:2b	VMware, Inc.
192.168.100.69	1a:b6:dd:e0:25:e9	(Unknown: locally administered)

6 packets received by filter, 0 packets dropped by kernel
Ending arp-scan 1.9.7: 256 hosts scanned in 1.954 seconds (131.01 hosts/sec). 6 responded
```

explanation of the output 

MAC 00:0c:29:d2:5a:2b how arp-scan knows that is vmware ? it's because the kind of OUI  ```00:0c:29``` use macchanger + l + | grep + "00:0c:29" they would tell us that it's vmware for the OUI which is organizationally unique identifier and the rest of the number belongs to he NIC d2:5a:2b nic means Network interface controller and actually the company made the NIC.


now that we have the IP let me introduce you to IPv4 and IPv6

because of the output we can notice that the IP that we will find vulnerabilities is IPv4, but how i know it?


```192.168.100.61``` is basically a numeric label that logically and hierarchically identifies an interface on a device's network that uses the internet protocol.

This IP is the same as bits, in conclusion. 


Why do I say they are bits? Because at a glance, I can see that there are 4 pairs of octets. They are called octets because there are 4 pairs of 8 bits here, 4 pairs  ```1octets,2octets,3octets,4octets```  Therefore, we know how I realized that there are 4 octets, but how did I realize that they are 8 bits? Well, that's because the 192 represented in binary in 8 bits would be, for example:

We know that by doing an ```echo``` of ```192.168.100.52```  it will show up in the console, so it will print it.

But if I want to divide it into 4 bytes, remember that 1 byte is 8 bits, so I want to represent a total of 32 bytes. We could represent the same example but with changes:

```bash 
echo "$().168.100.52"
``` 
Instead of 192, we are going to put $() so that we can try to return the output of a command executed at the system level.

Now we are going to execute a command at the system level and play with ```obase=2;``` to try to represent the number 192 in binary. We can do this by adding a | bc to represent the number in bytes, but what is ```bc``` ? this command is a calculator that can be used from the command line.

```bash 
echo $(echo "obase=2; 192" | bc).$(echo "obase=2; 168" | bc).$(echo "obase=2;100" | bc).(echo "obase=2; 52" | bc )
``` 
The output should be represented in binary, and since it is a 32-bit binary, the size of the IPs would be 2^32.
```bash 
❯ echo $(echo "obase=2; 192" | bc).$(echo "obase=2; 168" | bc).$(echo "obase=2;100" | bc).$(echo "obase=2; 52" | bc)
11000000.10101000.1100100.110100
```
"obase" is an option used in the "bc" command to set the output number base. In this case, the base is being set to 2, which represents the binary system.

The entire command is converting each octet of the IP address (192.168.100.52) into its binary representation. To do this, the "obase=2" option is used in each of the four "echo" commands, which sets the output of "bc" to binary. Then, the concatenation operator "." is used to join the results of each octet into a single 32-bit string

In other words, the size of the IP would be:


```bash
❯ echo "2^32" | bc
4294967296
```





That's why IPv6 exists, because there are very few IPv4 addresses compared to the world's population, and that's why IPv6 is gradually being implemented.

Since IPv6 uses a 128-bit format, it is 2^128.

```bash
echo "2^128" | bc
```



IPv6 addresses are represented by a 128-bit format, so it would be 2^128.

output 

```bash 
340282366920938463463374607431768211456
```


```24:18:c6:dc:bd:cd```



now we know the iPv4 for the machine that we can reach, now we have to enumerate to figure out what kind of machine is based on the TTL which is time to life.
```bash
ping -c3 192.168.100.61
```
in this case seems that does not work, so we might need an external binary i will use tcping because was writte in go,and the Programming language works very well with sockets and connections  

installation 

```bash
gitclone  https://github.com/cloverstd/tcping
```
usage binary + ip

```bash 
❯ ./tcping 192.168.100.52

where

3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2031ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.291/0.327/0.357/0.027 ms
```

- ```-TTL-``` : means the time to life of the machine, if it's 64 the machine is Linux, or if it's 124 the machine will be windows.
- ```--3 packets transmitted, 3 received``` : with this output means that the machine is active.

The first thing we will do when you know the IP and when you know that the machine is active we have to scan the target and see which ports are open.
To do this we will make use of nmap and use a series of parameters that will make our scan faster.:

```bash
nmap -p- --open -sS -Pn --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n 192.100.52
```
the meaning of each parameter is.:
- ```-p-``` : We indicate that the scan will be done for all ports.
- ```--open``` : We indicate that we are only interested in ports that are open.
- ```-sS``` : This flag indicates that we want to do a "SYN Scan" which means that the packets we will send will never complete the TCP connections and that will make our scan much less intrusive and quieter.
- ```-Pn``` : With this option we indicate that we do not want to do host discovery (since we know who our target is).
- ```--min-rate 5000``` : This flag can be exchanged for ```-T5```, both are intended to make our scanning faster (and noisier...). To be more detailed this flag indicates that we don't want to send less than 5,000 packets per second.
- ```-v``` : (verbose) To see which ports appear as we go along.
- ```-n``` : We don't want DNS resolution to be performed, since we are scanning an IP, not a domain.
output

```

At this point we know that there are 3 open ports: 80 (HTTP) and 22 (SSH), 21 (FTP) seeing this we have to make under consideration that we have 2 vias of get into the machine the SSH port and port 80 (at least to the outside), it can be deduced that the only way to enter the machine is through these services.

 once we know which ports are open we must perform the scan to those ports by running a series of scripts in order to obtain more information: server version, technology, possible vulnerabilities, etc...

```bash
nmap -sV -sC -p 80,22,21 192.168.100.52 -oN targeted
```


Where :

- ```-sV``` : If possible, it will show the version of the service running on each port.
- ```-A``` : We will run all relevant scripts (provided by nmap) on these ports.
- ```-p 80,22,21```: Open ports.
- ```-oN```: export the output to nmap format

Getting this output:

```php

To find out what we are dealing with, we will run **WhatWeb** in order to find the codename as well

```bash
❯ whatweb 192.168.100.52

```

seems that does not give us a lot of information.

So let's visit the web port
